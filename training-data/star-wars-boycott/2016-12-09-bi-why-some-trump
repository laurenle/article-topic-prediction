"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" has become the target of a political boycott online a week before it is released.

Some social-media users have come out against the new "Star Wars" spin-off movie on both Reddit and Twitter, where people have spoken out against the movie with the hashtag #DumpStarWars.

The boycott seems to have stemmed from a rumor that "Rogue One" was changed in reshoots and edits to make it slanted against President-elect Donald Trump. A writer for the film, Chris Weitz, says that story is "completely fake."

Others chimed in to protest "Rogue One," believing the film to be politically motivated.

Another source of ire for people boycotting the movie is the fact that Weitz has made comments on Twitter that appear to protest the election of Trump, including one tweet shortly after the election featuring the Rebel symbol from "Star Wars" with a safety pin through it, signifying unity. Weitz wrote: "Star Wars against hate. Spread it."

Separately, IndieWire reports that "Rogue One" has also been the target of criticism on a self-professed "alt-right" section of Reddit with ties to white supremacy. Users have pointed to the multicultural casting and leading female roles in the newest "Star Wars" movies (including "Force Awakens"). One such alt-right user called "Rogue One" "anti-white social engineering."
